# Dibl Flags ðŸš©

Open Source Feature flag implementation examples on a Supabase backend.

---

## Using This Repository

This repository serves as example code that can be re-used in your own projects
to set up feature flagging capabilities rather than paying out for a service.

## Features/Examples

- [ ] Basic Boolean flag
- [ ] Basic JSON flag
- [ ] Flag Schedules
- [ ] Flag User Subsets
- [ ] A/B test
- [ ] Feature Preview
- [ ] Flag Editing UI
- [ ] Flag Sign Off Process

## Working On This Repository

Either fork the repository or pull it and run locally.

To re-create you will need:

- A Vercel Account
- A Supabase Account

1. Connect Vercel to your fork repo and configure as needed.
2. In Supabase make a project then optionally use Vercel integration to pass environment variables etc. between them.
3. Pull environment variables locally and run migrations against the supabase project.

title: Example Deployment Flow
---
stateDiagram-v2
    Github
    Vercel
    Project: Dibl Flags
    Database: Supabase
    
    Github --> Vercel: Creates Build on PR
    Vercel --> Project: Build per branch
    Vercel --> Database: Database per branch (if enabled)
    Project --> Database
    Database --> Project
```

N.B. Can be easily adapted for any other Postgres database and hosting solution.

### Environment Variables

Ensure you have a `.env.local` file with the required environment variables set out
in `.env.example`.

You will receive errors on running the application if environment variables are not found.

New environment variables must be also configured in `./src/env.js`.

### Running Locally

This project is using [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as our javascript runtime which is different from `npm` or `yarn`.

It is worth making sure your editor has the plugin for [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/). 

#### First time setup install

_N.B._ These commands are meant to be run from the top level of the repository.

```bash
bun install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

#### Local Supabase

[Official Docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/getting-started?platform=npm)

Having installed the local dependencies.

##### Login to Supabase CLI & Link Project

```bash
supabase login
```

```bash
supabase link --project-ref $PROJECT_ID
```

_N.B. Upon linking you will be prompted for your database password._

##### Start Supabase

Make sure Docker has been started e.g. using Docker Desktop.

```bash
supabase start
```

Apply any new migrations.

```bash
supabase db reset
```

##### Managing Database Types

Keep your local types in sync with database changes.

[Official Docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/api/generating-types)

```bash
supabase gen types typescript --local > src/types/supabase.ts
```

_N.B. This should be run after every new migration is applied & local supabase must be running first._

##### Generate Database Migration

Via diffing local studio changes.

```bash
supabase db diff -f EXAMPLE_FILENAME_SUFFIX
```

##### Create Blank Database Migration

```bash
supabase migration new EXAMPLE_FILENAME_SUFFIX
```

This runs a full local supabase setup in docker and studio on `http://localhost:54323`.

##### Seed Data

[Official Docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/seeding-your-database)

Local development will be much easier with data to use and this is where seeding comes into.

Supabase Seeding is generally all done in `supabase/seed.sql`.

##### Stop Supabase

```bash
supabase stop
```

##### Database Branching [Optional]

:warning: This feature of Supabase is in early alpha and requires a pro plan/ incurs cost.

[Official Docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/branching#preparing-your-git-repository)

### Committing Code

We use the conventional commits standard to indicate version bumps.

- `fix` â€” to indicate a bug fix (PATCH) ex. v0.0.1
- `feat` â€” to indicate a new feature (MINOR) ex. v0.1.0
- `chore` â€” for updates that do not require a version bump (.gitignore, comments, etc.)
- `docs` â€” for updates to the documentation
- `BREAKING CHANGE` â€” regardless of type, indicates a Major release (MAJOR) ex. v1.0.0

### Preparing your PR

#### Versioning

This project uses a library called [Standard-Version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version)

Run the release script:

```bash
bun release
```

And push the created changes.

This automatically:

- Generates a changelog from your commit messages.
- Bumps the version numbers in `package.json`.
- Creates a new tags with the version number.

### Deploying A Release

This project uses Vercel for the builds and deployment.

Create a PR, then it will automatically generate a preview build and run the github actions.

On a successful PR merge to the `trunk` branch a production build will be kicked off.

### Main Technologies

If you are not familiar with the different technologies used in this project, please refer to the respective docs.

This was originally setup with [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/).

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) for the javascript runtime.
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) is the Meta framework used.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling.
- [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting and formatting.
- [Zod](https://zod.dev/) for TypeScript-first schema validation with static type inference.
