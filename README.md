## Working On This Repository

Either fork the repository or pull it and run locally.

### Tech stack

```mermaid

```

### Environment Variables

Ensure you have a `.env.local` file with the required environment variables set out
in `.env.example`.

You will receive errors on running the application if environment variables are not found.

New environment variables must be also configured in `./src/env.js`.

### Running Locally

This project is using [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as our javascript runtime which is different from `npm` or `yarn`.

It is worth making sure your editor has the plugin for [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/). 

#### First time setup install

_N.B._ These commands are meant to be run from the top level of the repository.

```bash
bun install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

### Committing Code

We use the conventional commits standard to indicate version bumps.

- `fix` â€” to indicate a bug fix (PATCH) ex. v0.0.1
- `feat` â€” to indicate a new feature (MINOR) ex. v0.1.0
- `chore` â€” for updates that do not require a version bump (.gitignore, comments, etc.)
- `docs` â€” for updates to the documentation
- `BREAKING CHANGE` â€” regardless of type, indicates a Major release (MAJOR) ex. v1.0.0

### Preparing your PR

#### Versioning

This project uses a library called [Standard-Version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version)

Run the release script:

```bash
bun release
```

And push the created changes.

This automatically:

- Generates a changelog from your commit messages.
- Bumps the version numbers in `package.json`.
- Creates a new tags with the version number.

### Deploying A Release

This project uses Vercel for the builds and deployment.

Create a PR, then it will automatically generate a preview build and run the github actions.

On a successful PR merge to the `trunk` branch a production build will be kicked off.
